            <p>If you haven't already done it, please take a look at the Handibot <strong>Safety Section</strong> in the <strong>Quick Launch Manual</strong>. [You should have received a hard copy with your tool. If not, there is a PDF version on the Handibot website under Support > Docs; but since you are probably connected to your tool in AP Mode at the moment, you'll need to get back on the internet to get a copy.]</p>
            <p><strong>Let's get started with your Handibot.</strong> Click through the check-list below to set-up your tool and cut a test file. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with using your Handibot. Read along then click the green labels here to put your tool in action. Later you can take on the more challenging work of creating your own projects and managing the Handibot more directly.</p>

                <p>Your Handibot should be all set to run a test file on the bottom half of the board that came attached to the bottom of your tool. Make sure the switch on the router is set to ON, and that the speed is set to about 3 on the dial on the router. </p>
              <h3><a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" id="call-c2"> Run the "Test" Job </a> << This time we'll acutally cut ...</h3>
                <p>If you have changed your cutter, you will need to re-measure its length. Measuring the cutter is done for you by having the tool "touch-off" on the Z-Zeroing plate. First the tool will move in X and Y to check its location. Then, when requested, <strong>rotate the plate into position and put the aligator clip on the cutter shank</strong>, and click "continue". [NOTE: Clip to the cutter-shank and not the collet-nut; the collet-nut does not provide a reliable electrical connection.]</p>

            <h2>Detailed Info on this FireUp! App</h2>
            <p>This App contains a variety of "helper" functions and information for setting-up and using your Handibot. It's designed to help you learn about your tool and its operation. Most functions have short-cuts or more direct methods for putting them to use rather than using this App. After you become knowledgeable and comfortable in the use of your tool, you may find you don't use the App itself anymore. Feel free to delete it (you can always get it back from the Handibot website)</p>
            <h3>Setting the XYZ Home Locations</h3>
            	<p>Determining the zero location of each axis is automatically done for you by moving into the end-stops of the axis and then backing off an exact known distance to the location where Zero for the particular axis is set, defining your Home Location.</p>
            	<p>The back-off distance is determined at the factory and saved as a persistant variable. As you get more experienced, you may want to change the back-off distance in order to move your zero locations to better suit your work, for a particular project, or just to make a slight adjustment of your zero location. You can modify the back-off distance for each axis in the <code>Preferences</code> tab (above).</p>
            	<p>Using the Set Home function in this app is the same thing as clicking on <strong>Macro#3</strong> in the system macros, where the motion instructions are actually stored. It also the same as using the <strong>[C3] Command</strong> in the Sb4 App or in the OpenSBP fabrication language. You can use each, interchangeably.</p> 

        		<div class="well" id="cartesian-message">
                  <p><strong>Your Handibot's Coordinate System</strong> </p>
              		<p>Your tool moves around in a Cartesian coordinate system. The X axis (left/right) and the Y axis (front/back) are in the plane of the material. The X = 0 and Y = 0 locations are at the bottom left corner as you face the front of the tool. Moving the tool-head to the right is moving in increasing value in the X axis, moving it towards the back is moving it in increasing value the Y axis. Up/Down motion of the router is the  Z axis. Down is the negative direction. Zero in the Z is typically set at the height that the cutter tip is just touching the surface of the material (though for special purposes it can be set anywhere). To explore the coordinate system, Play with the keypad on in the red, DRO panel on the right:</p>
              <button id="call-DRO-rollout" class="btn btn-primary">click here if the KEYPAD is not visble</button>
              <button id="call-DRO-hide" class="btn btn-primary">or, Hide the KEYPAD</button>
                  <p></p>
              		<p>The "Touch-and-Go App" can be very instructive in understanding the coordinate system. It is also helpful in just moving the tool around. Click the button below to try it out:</p>
              		<h4><a class="btn btn-success" id="call-touch-and-go"> start: Touch-and-Go </a></h4>
            	</div>

            <h3>Measuring Bit Length</h3>
            	<p>Measuring Bit Length is sometimes called Z-Zeoring, because we are really determing the zero location for the tip of the cutter in the Z axis. More importantly for a Handibot, we are determining the back-off distance from the top Z-axis, stop to having the tip of the cutter exactly at the material (at Zero). Your tool uses electrical contact with a Z-zero plate to tell exactly the distance the tip of the cutter from the stop. It then adds the known distance from the Z-zero plate to the material surface in order to calculate an overall back-off distance that we call, "current_cutter_Zoffset". So it is not really a measurement of the actual length of the bit, but the determination of an offset distance that is based on the exposed length of the cutter.</p>
            	<p>You will also see the "current_cutter_Zoffset" in the <code>Preferences</code> tab (above).</p>

          <h2>Preference Settings</h2>
	          <p>Your Handibot comes with a number of variables with preset values that it uses in operations to assist you.  These variables all have default values, but you are able to modify them to suit your specific needs. After you change them, the values will persist even when the tool is turned off. These preference settings are conceptually at a higher, use-and-utility level than the values set in the System Configuration available in the left side pull out; the latter define the actual motion and mechanical operation of the tool.</p>
	          <p>The preference settings are saved using a system of "persistent variables". There are several ways these persistent variables can be modified directly or by job files, but for the moment the simplest approach is to just change them here.</p>
