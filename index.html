            <p>We'll move the Z-axis &emdash; it's the up-down, vertical axis that moves the router &emdash; to a higher position. The tool will bang into the upper limit (but it won't do any damage.) So, close the lid, then click the next green label&hellip;</p>

                <p>Click on target in upper right corner and use the arrow buttons to move the Handibot. Despite the noise, it is safe to move the Handibot to all extreme directions. Just beware of moving the router all the way down, the installed bit can crash into your material, damaging the bit.</p>

                <p>And yes, you'll need to use the <strong>Green Button</strong> again to get things started. Note that you can always use this "Set XYZ Home" function when needed to make sure the coordinates are all calibrated as they should be. This same function is included in the <code>FireUp!</code> App that will be useful to you for daily set-up tasks. We're making sure we are exactly "homed" here in all axes before running the test job.</p>

              <span class='btn btn-primary'> NOW, let's try running a job ... </span>
                <p>Your Handibot should be all set to run a test file on the board that came attached to the bottom of your tool. We'll run the same job on the lower half of the board that was run in the top of the work area before it left Handibot HQ. It was our check to make sure your tool was working well.</p>
                <p><strong>Job Preparation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Make sure the switch on the router is set to ON, and that the speed is set to about 3 on the dial on the router.</li>
                	<li>If you have a vacuum handy you can hook it up to the outlet on the Handibot, but we won't be making a lot of dust.</li>
                	<li>To run this project, we will be making use the <code>Job Manager</code> system-app which you will normally access from the left-side panel when you are ready to run a job. </li>
                </ul> 
              <hr width = "90%" noshade>
                <p><strong>After you've run this first job ... you will have hopefully gotten the basic idea of how a job is done with a Handibot. After it's done, if you come back to this App and move on to the <code>Next Steps</code> tab above, we'll introduce you to where you will want to go from here.</strong></p>
                <p> </p>
	            <p>You'll first go to the "Start" panel for the Job Manager. Just click the green arrow to get the job started when you are ready. You'll need to provide authorization with that Green Button. <strong>As the file runs, note that there is a STOP indicator at the bottom of the window. Hit this Stop, or the flashing red square if you need to Stop the file!</strong> </p>

            <h3>Handibot Utility Apps</h3>
            	<p>Most Apps will provide a direct way to carry out specific jobs or tasks. <code>Hole Cutter </code>is an example of a basic utility App.</p>
            <h3>More Advanced Apps</h3>
            	<p>On-board Apps can also carry out some simple parametric design tasks. Check out <code>Beamer</code> and <code>TerrainMan</code>. Basically set the parameters and then click "Done" or "Cut" and your project will be sent to the Job Manager to run.</p>
            <h3>Specialty Apps</h3>
                <ul>
                	<li><code>Touch-and-Go</code> will move your tool-head to a designated location.</li>
                	<li><code>Sb4</code> is a traditional CNC interface, similar to ShopBot's standard interface.</li>
                	<li><code>Fire-Up!</code> will help you with daily Handibot set-up activities.</li>
                	<li><code>theNews</code> will keep you posted on the latest Handibot News and Bulletins.</li>
                	<li><code>ExampleApp</code> is the definitive example of how to create an App.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Putting Your Handibot on a Wi-Fi Network</h3>
              <p>So far, you've been exploring Handibotting using the direct Access Point (AP) Mode, wireless link to the tool. You can also put Handibot/FabMo on your Wi-Fi network in order to give it access to jobs and resources in the cloud or over your network. For instructions, put your device back on the internet and go to: <strong>docs.handibot.com</strong> in order to access the: <em>"Joining a Network"</em> document.</p>
            <h3>Creating your own Jobs: DESIGN</h3>
                <p>Once you've got a feel for how the FabMo platform works and the usefullness of Apps, you'll want to start working on designing your own projects that you will run using the Job Manager. We've provided some great software to get started with design for digital fabrication.</p>
