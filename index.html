			  <h1>Hello! Welcome to Handibotting ...</h1>
	            <p>First, to help you finish unpacking we'll move the Z-axis &mdash; it's the up-down, vertical axis that moves the router &mdash; to a higher position so you can remove the protective foam cylinder.</p>
	            <p>The tool will bang into its upper stop to make sure it is all the way up (this doesn't do any damage). So, close the lid, then click the green bar just below&hellip;</p>
              <h3><a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" id="call-zup"> Click to Move the Z-axis up a little bit for clearance*</a> </h3>

            <div>  
              <h4><strong>*Note that you’ll always be asked for permission</strong> whenever the Handibot is about to move. <strong>To OK motion</strong>, push and hold (1 sec) the plastic <strong>Green Button</strong> on the top of the tool.</h4>

              <h4><strong>Moving Your Handibot Around&hellip;</strong></h4>
                <p>You use the <strong>KEYPAD</strong> to move the head of your Handibot around to get it in position for cutting, changing bits, or out-of-the-way.</p>
                <p>Click on "Target" in upper right corner to toggle the KEYPAD in and out. Use the arrow buttons to move the Handibot around. If you move the Handibot too far in one direction of another, it will bang into its stops. Despite the noise, it is safe to move the Handibot to all extreme directions. Just beware of moving the router all the way down, the installed bit can crash into your material, damaging the bit. Also note that if you run into the end-of-travel in any direction, the location of the tool with respect to your "Home" point will be lost.</p>

                <p>Use this <strong>Green Button</strong> to get setting the Home Location started. Homing will be done for all 3 axes, so make sure the area is clear for your Handibot to move around.</p>
                <p>Note: if you manually (ie. using the KEYPAD) move the Handibot position and run into an end-stop after homing XYZ, you will have to set the XYZ home location again. The function to Set the Home Location is also included in the <code>FireUp!</code> App. The FireUp! will be useful for daily set-up tasks. It also contains a more detailed explanation of Setting Home and the special case of setting the Z-axis after a bit change.</p>

                <p>Your Handibot should be all set to run a test cut file on the board that came attached to the bottom of your tool. We'll run the same job on the lower half of the board that was run in the top of the work area before it left Handibot HQ.</p>
                <p>To run this project, we will be making use the <code>Job Manager</code> system-app which you will normally access from the left-side panel when you are ready to run a job.</p>
                <p><strong>Job Preparation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Switch the router ON, and ensure the speed is set to 3 on the router dial.</li>
                	<li>If you have a vacuum handy you can hook it up to the outlet on the Handibot, but we won't be making a lot of dust.</li>
                	<li>Close the hood. </li>

	            <p>If you haven't already done it, please take a look at the Handibot <strong>Safety Section</strong> from the <strong>Handibot Manual</strong>. [You should have received a hard copy with your tool. If not, there is a PDF version on the web at docs.handibot.com; but since you are probably connected to your tool in AP Mode at the moment, you'll need to get back on the Internet in order to view a copy.]</p>

              <p>Upon completion of the cut, hit target button and use keypad to move the Handibot to the rear.</p>

            <p>The Dashboard provides access for all the work you will be doing with your Handibot. Note its System Apps in the left-side panel, the App Area in the center, and the right-side, DRO panel with Keypad for manually moving the tool-head.<p>

            <h3>Handibot Utility Apps</h3>
            	<p>Most Apps will provide a direct way to carry out specific jobs or tasks. <code>Hole Cutter </code>is an example of a basic utility App.</p>
            <h3>More Advanced Apps</h3>
            	<p>On-board Apps can also carry out some simple parametric design tasks. Check out <code>Beamer</code> and <code>TerrainMan</code>. Basically set the parameters and then click "Done" or "Cut" and your project will be sent to the Job Manager to run.</p>
            <h3>Specialty Apps</h3>
                <ul>
                	<li><code>Touch-and-Go</code> will move your tool-head to a designated location.</li>
                	<li><code>Sb4</code> is a traditional CNC interface, similar to ShopBot's standard interface.</li>
                	<li><code>Fire-Up!</code> will help you with daily Handibot set-up activities.</li>
                	<li><code>theNews</code> will keep you posted on the latest Handibot News and Bulletins.</li>
                	<li><code>ExampleApp</code> is the definitive example of how to create an App.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Putting Your Handibot on a Wi-Fi Network</h3>
              <p>So far, you've been exploring Handibotting using the direct Access Point (AP) Mode, wireless link to the tool. You can also put Handibot/FabMo on your Wi-Fi network in order to give it access to jobs and resources in the cloud or over your network. For instructions, put your device back on the internet and go to: <strong>docs.handibot.com</strong> in order to access the: <em>"Joining a Network"</em> document.</p>
            <h3>Creating your own Jobs: DESIGN</h3>
                <p>Once you've got a feel for how the FabMo platform works and the usefullness of Apps, you'll want to start working on designing your own projects that you will run using the Job Manager. We've provided some great software to get started with design for digital fabrication.</p>
