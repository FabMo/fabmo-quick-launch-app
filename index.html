            <h2><strong>Hello! Welcome to Handibotting ...</strong></h2>
            <p>If you haven't already done it, please take a look at the Handibot <strong>Safety Section</strong> from the <strong>Handibot Manual</strong>. [You should have received a hard copy with your tool. If not, there is a PDF version on the web at docs.handibot.com; but since you are probably connected to your tool in AP Mode at the moment, you'll need to get back on the Internet in order to view a copy.]</p>
            <p><strong>Let's get started with your Handibot.</strong> Click through the action-list below to set-up your tool and carve a test file. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with using your Handibot. Read along then click the <strong>green labels</strong> as you encountere them to put your tool in action. Later you can take up the more challenging work of designing and creating your own projects and, running and managing your Handibot more directly.</p>
            <div>
            <hr width = "90%" noshade>
              <span class='btn btn-primary'> Hey first things first ... let's remove the packing.</span>
              <p>Let's let the tool do some of the work. We'll move the Z axis -- it's the up-down, vertical axis that moves the router -- to a higher position to allow you to remove the protective foam-cylinder from around the cutter. So, close the lid, then click the next green label ...</p>
              <p><strong>Oh ... BTW, you'll be asked for permission</strong> whenever the Handibot is about to move! Push and Hold (1 sec) the plastic <strong>Green Button</strong> on the top of the tool. </p>
              <p><strong> ... and yes, the tool will bang into the top </strong> limit because we want to make sure it is all the way up. (It won't do any damage, but if it gets annoying, you can hit the <strong>STOP Button</strong> at the bottom of the screen.)</p>
              <h3><a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" id="call-zup"> CLICK HERE > to move Z-axis up a little bit for clearance ... </a> </h3>

                <p>And yes, you'll need to use the <strong>Green Button</strong> again to get things started. Note that you can always use this "Set XYZ Home" function when needed to make sure the coordinates are all calibrated as they should be. This same function is included in the <code>FireUp!</code> App that will be useful to you for daily set-up tasks.</p>

                <p>When we aren't helping you out in an App like this, you will use the "Keypad" in the right-side, "DRO", panel to move your tool around. Feel free to try its Keypad buttons by clicking on them -- the button in the middle enables the arrow keys on a PC. It's probably not visible so you can use the labels below to toggle the right-side panel in and out (and normally, you can use the little "hamburger" icon at the top right of the Dashboard to do this):</p>

                <p>Your Handibot should be all set to run a test file on the board that came attached to the bottom of your tool. We'll run the same job on the lower half of the board that was run in the top of the work area before it left Handibot HQ. It was our check to make sure your tool was working well.</p>
                <p><strong>Job Preparation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>If you feel like your tool may have lost its location (e.g. you had to turn it off to move it, or you ran it into the hard stops when you were Keypadding around ...), then feel free to run the "Set XYZ Home" function above.
                	<li>Make sure the switch on the router is set to ON, and that the speed is set to about 3 on the dial on the router.</li>
                	<li>If you have a vacuum handy you can hook it up to the outlet on the Handibot, but we won't be making a lot of dust.</li>
                	<li>To run this project, we will be making use the <code>Job Manager</code> system-app which you will normally access from the left-side panel when you are ready to run a job. </li>
                </ul> 
              <hr width = "90%" noshade>
                <p><strong>After you've run this first job ... you will have hopefully gotten the basic idea of how a job is done with a Handibot. After it's done, if you come back to this App and move on to the <code>Next Steps</code> tab above, we'll introduce you to where you will want to go from here.</strong></p>
                <p> </p>
	            <p>You'll first go to the "Start" panel for the Job Manager. Just click the green arrow to get the job started when you are ready. You'll need to provide authorization with that Green Button. <strong>As the file runs, note that there is a STOP indicator at the bottom of the window. Hit this Stop, or the flashing red square to Stop the file!</strong> </p>

            <h3>Handibot Utility Apps</h3>
            	<p>Most Apps will provide a direct way to carry out specific jobs or tasks. <code>Hole Cutter </code>is an example of a basic utility App.</p>
            <h3>More Advanced Apps</h3>
            	<p>On-board Apps can also carry out some simple parametric design tasks. Check out <code>Beamer</code> and <code>TerrainMan</code>. Basically set the parameters and then click "Done" or "Cut" and your project will be sent to the Job Manager to run.</p>
            <h3>Specialty Apps</h3>
                <ul>
                	<li><code>Touch-and-Go</code> will move your tool-head to a designated location.</li>
                	<li><code>Sb4</code> is a traditional CNC interface, similar to ShopBot's standard interface.</li>
                	<li><code>Fire-Up!</code> will help you with daily Handibot set-up activities.</li>
                	<li><code>theNews</code> will keep you posted on the latest Handibot News and Bulletins.</li>
                	<li><code>ExampleApp</code> is the definitive example of how to create an App.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Creating your own Jobs: DESIGN</h3>
                <p>Once you've got a feel for how the FabMo platform works and the usefullness of Apps, you'll want to start working on designing your own projects that you will run using the Job Manager. We've provided some great software to get started with design for digital fabrication.</p>
