                    <h1>Hello! Welcome to Handibotting ...</h1>
                    <p>First, to help you finish unpacking we'll move the Z-axis &mdash; it's the up-down or vertical axis that moves the router &mdash; to a higher position so you can remove the protective foam cylinder.</p>
                    <p>The tool will bang into its upper stop for a bit to make sure it is all the way up (this doesn't do any damage). So, close the lid, then click the green bar just below&hellip;</p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <div class="btn btn-success btn-lg" id="call-zup">Click to move the <br> Z-axis up for clearance*</div>
                    </div>
                </div>


     
                    <h4><strong>*Note that you’ll always be asked for permission</strong> whenever the Handibot is about to move. <strong>To OK motion</strong>, push and hold (1 sec) the plastic <strong>Green Button</strong> on the top of the tool.</h4>

                    <h4><strong>Moving Your Handibot Around&hellip;</strong></h4>
                    <p>You use the <strong>KEYPAD</strong> to move the head of your Handibot around to get it in position for cutting, changing bits, or just to get it out-of-the-way.</p>
                    <p>Click on "Target" in upper right corner of the screen to toggle the KEYPAD in and out. Use the arrow buttons to move the Handibot around. If you move the Handibot too far in one direction or another, it will bang into its stops. Despite the noise, it is safe to move the Handibot into these extremes. You won't hurt anything. Just beware of moving the router all the way down as the installed bit can crash into your material, damaging the bit.</p>

                    <p>Use this <strong>Green Button</strong> set your Home Location now. Setting the home locations will be done for all 3 axes, so make sure the area is clear for your Handibot to move around.</p>
                    <p>Note: if you manually move the Handibot using the KEYPAD and run into an end-stop after setting home for an axis, you will have to set the XYZ home locations again. The function to Set the Home Location is included in the <code>Fire-Up!</code> App. The Fire-Up! App will be useful for daily set-up tasks.</p>

                    <h4><strong>NOW that you've got it all figured out, let's try running a job&hellip;</strong></h4>
                    <p>Your Handibot should be all set to run a test cut file on the board that came attached to the bottom of your tool (hopefully it is still bolted on). To test everything out we'll run the same job on the lower half of the board that was run in the top part of the work area before it left Handibot HQ.</p>
                    <p>To run this project, we will be making use the <code>Job Manager</code> system-app which you will normally access from the left-side panel when you are ready to run a job.</p>
                    <p><strong>Job Preparation:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Switch the router to ON, and ensure the speed is set to 3 on the router dial.</li>
                        <li>We'll be making some sawdust, so if you have a shop-vac or vacuum cleaner handy you should hook it up to the outlet on the Handibot.</li>
                        <li>Close the hood. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Just a couple last things before running the test cut:</strong> </p>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>After you start by clicking the Green bar below, a green arrow will appear in the <code>Job Manager</code> which you will need to click to start the "Job".</li>
                        <li>And, as before, you'll also need to press the <strong>Green Button</strong> on the top of the tool to authorize the action.</li>
                        <li><strong>As the file runs, note that there is a STOP indicator at the bottom of the window. Hit this Stop, or the plastic Red Button on the Handibot if you need to Stop the file!</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>After completing the test cut, relaunch this <code>Quick Launch</code> App and click on the <code>Next Steps</code> tab.</li>

                  <h2>Next Steps in Working with Handibot</h2>

                  <p>If you haven't already done it, please take a look at the Handibot <strong>Safety Section</strong> from the <strong>Handibot Manual</strong>. [You should have received a hard copy of the Safety Section with your tool. If not, there is a PDF version on the web at docs.handibot.com; but since you are probably connected to your tool in AP Mode at the moment, you'll need to get back on the Internet in order to view a copy.]</p>

                  <p>Also, as you have now finished running the test file, <strong>it would be a good time to remove the test panel from the bottom of your Handibot -- if you have not already done so</strong>. There are two bolts holding the panel on. Removing the panel will give your Handibot full access for machining surfaces and materials below it. You can always make convenient jigs and fixtures using a variation of this method for attaching your tool to a board. And, if you have not already seen it, check out the "Accessory Base" in the Handibot Store. It provides an enclosed work area for small projects.</p>

                  <h3>The Dashboard</h3>
                  <p>The <strong>Dashboard</strong> provides access for all the work you will be doing with your Handibot. Note its <strong>System Apps</strong> in the left-side panel, the general <strong>App Area</strong> in the center, and the right-side, <strong>DRO panel with Keypad</strong> for manually moving the tool-head.</p>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p class='instr-photo'> </p>

                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <h3>Handibot Utility Apps</h3>
                          <p>Most Apps will provide a direct way to carry out specific jobs or tasks. <code>Hole Cutter </code>is an example of a basic utility App.</p>
                          <h3>More Advanced Apps</h3>
                          <p>On-board Apps can also carry out some simple parametric design tasks. Check out <code>Beamer</code> and <code>TerrainMan</code>. Basically set the parameters and then click "Done" or "Cut" and your project will be sent to the Job Manager to run.</p>
                          <h3>Specialty Apps</h3>
                          <ul>
                              <li><code>Smooth Sketch</code> do quick and fun drawings and carve them into a surface.</li>
                              <li><code>Touch-and-Go</code> will move your tool-head to a designated location.</li>
                              <li><code>Sb4</code> is a traditional CNC interface, similar to ShopBot's standard interface.</li>
                              <li><code>Fire-Up!</code> will help you with daily Handibot set-up activities.</li>
                              <li><code>theNews</code> will keep you posted on the latest Handibot News and Bulletins.</li>
                              <li><code>ExampleApp</code> is the definitive example of how to create an App.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <h3>Putting Your Handibot on a Wi-Fi Network</h3>
                          <p>So far, you've been exploring Handibotting using the direct Anchor Point (AP) Mode, a direct wireless link to your tool. You can also put Handibot/FabMo on your Wi-Fi network to give it access to jobs and resources on your network or in the internet cloud. If you don't have instructions handy, you can get them by putting your device back on the internet and going to: <strong>docs.handibot.com</strong> in order to access the: <em>"Hooking-Up: Network mode"</em> document.</p>
                          <h3>Creating your own Jobs: DESIGN</h3>
                          <p>Once you've got a feel for how the FabMo platform works and the usefullness of Apps, you'll want to start working on designing your own projects, projects that you will run using the Job Manager. We've provided some great software to get started with design for digital fabrication.</p>
